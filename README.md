# Module Project: Redux - Car Sales
implement React-Redux as the state management system

## Directions

1. set up empty reducer and initialState
2. action creators
3. reducer logic
4. connect components

## _MVP Requirements:_

- [ ] Move state to the Redux store
- [ ] Set up the Redux flow
- [ ] Be able to add features to their car
- [ ] Be able to remove added features from their car
- [ ] Total updates as user adds and removes features

## Stretch Problems

- [ ] Use Redux hooks instead of HOCs
- [ ] Implement React-Router and add a starter page where the user can choose a car. Each car should have different features that have different pricing.
- [ ] Look into the docs for Bulma and change up the styling.
- [ ] Implement an API from one of these sites [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=car+sales+api&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS809US809&oq=car+sales+api&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3580j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
