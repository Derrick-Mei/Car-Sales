# Module Project: Redux - Car Sales
implement React-Redux as the state management system

## Directions

1. install redux react-redux node-sass
2. set up empty reducer and initialState
3. createStore
4. wrap app in provider and pass in store
5. connect component to redux store
6. convert from using State in App.js to using props
7. action creators - ADD_FEATURES REMOVE_FEATURES
8. reducer logic
9. import actionCreators to app and connect them
10. complete functions in app.js, pass them down as props and add to onClick

## _MVP Requirements:_

- [x] Move state to the Redux store
- [x] Set up the Redux flow
- [x] Be able to add features to their car
- [x] Be able to remove added features from their car
- [x] Total updates as user adds and removes features

## Stretch Problems

- [ ] Use Redux hooks instead of HOCs
- [ ] Implement React-Router and add a starter page where the user can choose a car. Each car should have different features that have different pricing.
- [ ] Look into the docs for Bulma and change up the styling.
- [ ] Implement an API
